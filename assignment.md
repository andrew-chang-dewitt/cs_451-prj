# Term project

This document describes what your course project must fulfill and provides you with choices for your project topic. You're also welcome to explore variations of these project ideas, and to propose project ideas that aren't on this list. Please discuss variations or ideas with the instructor before starting work on a project.

## Project Design:

Before starting to work on the project, you must submit a Project Design by the deadline that's shown on the course calendar. The design consists of a PDF file that describes:

- (a) What you will build and how you will build it
- (b) What programming language(s) and dependencies (e.g., tools, libraries) you plan to use
- (c) How your implementation will be structured (as modules)
- (d)At least 3 examples of inputs that your implementation should be able to handle, and the output that it's expected to produce.

## Project Outcomes:

Your project submission (at the Progress Update or final submission stages) should consist of the following:

1. **Documentation** (up to 5 pages, as PDF)&mdash;This should describe:
   - (a) What the project does
   - (b) How to use your implementation
   - (c) Limitations of your implementation
   - (d) What you'd add if you had 3 more months to work on this project.
2. **Working code**&mdash;Unless the project requires a specific programming language, you're free to choose any language you like, but your implementation must run on FABRIC and make use of JupyterHub. Bonus marks (5%) will be given for the use (or creation of) notebook widgets that demonstrate your work.
3. **Recorded demo** (as mp4, lasting at least 2 minutes, and showing your project being invoked on at least 3 test inputs).
